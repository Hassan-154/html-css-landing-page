    <p style="margin-top: 8px;"> ◉ COMPETITION GAME THAT PAYS REALMONEY <br> At its core StopClock is a fast reaction, tap reflex game. You need
      to stop the clock, but it’s not a
      simple challenge. Many fields on the board won’t stop the clock and there are penalties as well.
      So in the attempt to locate the Stop button, you must avoid the 1-second Time Bomb penalties
      spread across the board. If you have ever played the Stopwatch Challenge on YouTube, then
      StopClock is the perfect competition game for you but here, the best players will win real money
      and get paid in cash via PayPal</p>
